## üèóÔ∏è How It Works: A Two-Part System

The application is designed with a highly performant and cost-effective static-first architecture.

### 1. Backend Generation (Daily Job)

- A Node.js script (`scripts/generate.js`) is designed to be run once per day via an automated scheduler (like a GitHub Action or a cron job).
- This script uses **template-based generation** and an **intelligent backtracking algorithm**, guided by the **OpenAI API (GPT-4o)**, to create a valid, high-quality 6x6 crossword puzzle.
- The script handles complex logic like correct clue numbering and ensures all words are valid and interlocking.
- The final puzzle is saved as a static JSON file (e.g., `public/puzzles/2025-07-06.json`).

**Dictionary & Validation:**
A key part of the generation process is word validation. Every answer is checked against a custom, curated dictionary to ensure quality and relevance. This dictionary consists of:

- **`english_words.txt`**: A base vocabulary of approximately 40,000 common English words (up to 6 letters).
- **`indian_words.txt`**: A specialized list of over 2,300 words, including ~1,250 India-specific terms (up to 6 letters), names, and places to enrich the theme.
- **Asset for Future Expansion:** The repository also includes `english_words_full.txt`, a comprehensive dictionary containing over 400,000 English words of all lengths. This file is not used by the current 6x6 puzzle generator to keep the answers common and concise, but it is ready to be implemented for future features like larger grids (e.g., 7x7 or greater).

### 2. Frontend Application (Static Site)

- The user-facing application is a pure **static site** built with React and Vite.
- When you open the app, it simply fetches the pre-generated JSON file for the current date.
- **The app never calls the OpenAI API directly during gameplay.** This ensures a fast user experience, zero API costs for users, and enhanced security.
- **Robust Cross-Browser Layout:** The frontend uses a combination of modern CSS Grid and a custom React hook (`useWindowSize`) to create a stable, full-viewport layout that works consistently across browsers, including the notoriously tricky mobile Safari.

## üöÄ Getting Started

Follow these instructions to run the application on your local machine.

### Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (version 18.x or later)
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) or [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/)

### 1. Running the Client App

This is all you need to do to play the game locally.

1.  **Clone the repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/dodo-krossword.git
    cd dodo-krossword
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies:**

    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

3.  **Run the development server:**
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```
    The application will be available at `http://localhost:5173`. It will try to fetch today's puzzle and fall back to a sample if it's not found.

### 2. (Optional) Running the Puzzle Generation Script

If you want to generate your own puzzles, you'll need an OpenAI API key.

1.  **Create an environment file:**
    Create a new file named `.env` in the root of the project.

2.  **Add your API key:**
    Add your OpenAI API key to the `.env` file.

    ```env
    OPENAI_API_KEY="sk-YourSecretApiKeyHere"
    ```

3.  **Run the generation script:**
    Execute the script using `tsx`. This will generate a new puzzle for the current date and save it in the `public/puzzles/` directory.
    ```bash
    npx tsx scripts/generate.js
    ```
